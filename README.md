## DeFi Kingdom Clone

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone repository! This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of DeFi Kingdoms on the Avalanche network. Below are the steps to set up your environment, deploy contracts, and start building your game.

## Set Up Your EVM Subnet

Follow the guide provided by Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network. This subnet will serve as the underlying infrastructure for deploying your game contracts. 

## Define Your Native Currency

Create your own native currency to be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom Clone. You can deploy a custom ERC-20 token using Solidity and Remix, specifying the token name, symbol, total supply, and any other parameters relevant to your game.

## Connect to Metamask

Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask to enable users to interact with your game using their Metamask wallets. Follow the steps provided in our guide to configure Metamask to connect to your custom EVM Subnet.

## Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy the basic building blocks of your game, including smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will define the game rules, manage liquidity pools, tokens, and other essential functionalities.

## Readme File

Please refer to the README.md file in this repository for detailed instructions on setting up your environment, deploying contracts, and interacting with your DeFi Kingdom Clone. The README will provide step-by-step guidance, including prerequisites, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
